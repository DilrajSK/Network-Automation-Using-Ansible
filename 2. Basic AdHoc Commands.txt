ANSIBLE AD-HOC COMMANDS
******************************************************************

1. ansible <R1> -m raw -a	"show version" -u <dilraj> -k (Display software version for Router R1)

2. ansible <gns3-ios> -i ./hosts -m raw -a "show version" -u <dilraj> -k (Display software version for all devices in gns3-ios group)
NOTE: Use keyword 'all' in place of "gns3-ios" in case we need to do the same for all the devices in the inventory file.

Sample Inventory file:
root@Auto:~# more hosts
[gns3-ios]
R1
R2
R3

3. ansible R1 -m raw -a "show version" -u <dilraj> -k | grep Version (This will just show the line which has the keyword "version" in its show version)

4. ansible R1 -m raw -a "show run" -u <dilraj> -k > show_run.txt (Store the running config in a file)

5. Use arguments such as "sh mac-address-table" or "sh arp" while troubleshooting some issue and grep the MAC/IP address by using the below command sample:
ansible R1 -m raw -a "sh mac-address-table" -u <dilraj> -k | grep '<type few letters of MAC address or IP address>'

6. If need to search for multiple keywords in grep, use the operator \| in between the keywords. Sample below:
ansible R1 -m raw -a "sh mac-address-table" -u <dilraj> -k | grep 'SUCCESS\|1111.2222.3333'
